In C++ is better not ever to use pointers

Every time you define a variable with auto is better to initialize it:
auto int i{0};

When you use a return, do not pass a const to allow the compiler optimization
Unless there are serious memory issues, is better to pass by value (an let the compiler do the optimization)

constexpr a function that is used at compile time (if possible)

Lambda functions with capture are not identical to standard functions, therefore we need to use std::function<> to generalize the function type passed as a parameter

POSIX: The Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems

Use noexcept:
void funName(bla bla bla) noexcept
{
...
}
To avoid a function to throw exceptions (typically used with operators to be used by standard library)

Template defined in header file are implicitly inlined

Suffix "s" to convert a literal to an std::string

std::concept are used for SFINAE

Functions are "first class objects" == which means that they are equal to a class and they can be passed by reference to a function (in C only by pointers)

Initialization with {} or ():
1. () can be misinterpreted with a function
2. compiler prioritizes list constructor, therefore if you have an overloaded constructor and one of them uses an initializer list, then you might not be able to call the other constructor that uses just ()
e.g. std::vector<int> a{20, 0};
I would like to initialize 20 elements to zero, but in this case, the compiler will create a vector with two elements: 20, 0

std::move actually prepare for move --> if assigned to && then the transfer of ownership will occur, otherwise, it won't
It make sense only for types that can have the "empty" state

RAII: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization

When defining a binary operator, it is better to define it as a member function friend (aka hidden friend) if you have implicit conversion
e.g. complex r = 5 + complex_number; // Won't work

- Value (or "value semantics")

- Subject (actual variable containing the value)

- Relation (use of reference, pointer, raw pointer)

- Manager

  - Scope
    Non-copyable, non-movable
    Can be returned from factory functions (C++17)

    struct Scoped
    {
        [[nodiscard]] Scoped();  // Acquire resource
                      ~Scoped(); // release resource
                      Scoped& operator=(Scoped &&other) = delete;

        private:
            Resource resource; // Only one
    };

  - Unique
    Move-only, transfer of ownership
    Resource can not be easily duplicated

    class Unique
    {
        std::optional<Resource> resource;
        void release() noexcept;

        public:
                          Unique() = default;
            [[nodiscard]] Unique(Params p); // Acquire resource ~Unique() noexcept;
                          Unique& operator=(Unique &&other) & noexcept;
                          Unique(Unique &&other) noexcept;
    };

  - General
    Copyable, Move-operation for optimization
    Resource can be duplicated

    struct General
    {
        General() = default;
        ~General();

        General (const General &other);
        General& operator= (const General &other) &;

        General (General &&other) noexcept; // Optional optimization
        General& operator= (General &&other) & noexcept; // Optional optimization
    };

std::string_view: since C++14 to handle sequence of char --> but better use std::string which have View semantics

In C++ do NOT use the heap
   std::unique_ptr<T> is a Manager type to be preferred if you REALLY need to use the heap
   To change the stack size in Linux: uname -s number

If you need to handle C array (int a[3]{1,2,3};) use std::span<int> which converts it to std::span automatically deducing the size at compile time

Within <...> we could either use typename or class keywords, they are equivalent

When you have a single argument constructor and a constructor with an initialization list, it is good to define the "explicit" constructor with an initialization list
To access something in the global namespace: ::name(...); The two colons allow you to refer to the global namespace

DesDeMovA works because we declare a move assignment operator, even if it is then defined as deleted

Iterator traits are deprecated, not for example std::iter_value_t
